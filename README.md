# Expression_Evaluator

Description:
Developing a foundational component for an expression interpreter that accurately classifies tokens into identifiers, operators, and immediates (including arithmetic operators). Implementing a robust type checking system using efficient data structures and memory management techniques. Aiming to handle arithmetic expressions while ensuring correct parsing, evaluation, and error handling.

Key Components:
- Token Classification: Identifies and categorizes tokens, including arithmetic operators.
- Data Structures: Represents and manages numerical values and arithmetic expressions.
- Memory Management: Prevents memory leaks and optimizes resource usage.
- Error Handling: Detects and reports invalid expressions, such as division by zero or incorrect operator usage.
- Arithmetic Evaluation: Evaluates arithmetic expressions based on operator precedence and associativity rules.
- Integration: Works seamlessly with other modules to provide a complete arithmetic calculation functionality.

Current Progress:
- Successfully implemented a preliminary token classification algorithm.
- Completed initial memory management.
- Implementing arithmetic evaluation functionality.

Future Plans:
- Refine the token classification algorithm for improved accuracy.
- Explore additional memory optimization techniques.
- Enhance error handling capabilities.
- Test the module with a variety of arithmetic expressions.
